Use unnamed variable instead of ex at line 47.
Intervention: Actually keep the code at line 47 intact but replace the error message at line 48 with the exception message of ex at line 47.
Insert a code after line 60 that will throw illegal argument exception with the message "p cannot be zero." if p is zero.
Save Main.java.
